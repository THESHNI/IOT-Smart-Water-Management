# IOT-Smart-Water-Management
This simple script simulates a water level sensor that generates random values and sends alerts when the water level is too low or high. In a real IoT system, this data would come from actual sensors, and alerts would be sent to a cloud platform or app.

A Smart Water System using IoT technologies enables more efficient and sustainable management of water resources. By combining sensors, real-time data monitoring, cloud computing, and automation, these systems help optimize water usage, detect problems early, reduce waste, and ensure that water is distributed appropriately across various sectors. The integration of smart water systems is an essential step towards creating smarter, more sustainable cities, agricultural systems, and industries.
